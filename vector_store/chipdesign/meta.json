That’s because we recognize the letters and their \ncombinations. \n\nNow imagine that we don’t know any letters and only understand two symbols — \n0 and 1. \n\nIn such a situation, we will have to use only these two symbols (0 and 1) to \ncommunicate. If we want to create any word, we’ll do it using just these two \nsymbols. \n\nIf we have to say something, we’ll have to use only 1 and 0. Any words we create \nwill also be formed using 1 and 0 only. \n\nFortunately, that’s not the case, and we have many words for communication \nwhich we can use to understand and talk. \n\nBut this is not the case with semiconductor microchips. Semiconductor \nmicrochips understand only two things — 0 and 1. So it’s important to know this. \nAnd since there are only two symbols, the system is called a binary system. \n\n \n\f🔢 Decimal Number System \nOn the left of the image, we see the Decimal Number System. \n\nThis is the number system we most commonly use in our daily lives. We are all \nvery familiar with it. \n\nIn the decimal system, we start counting from 0: \n\n0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 \n\nHere we use a total of 10 different symbols (digits) — that’s why it’s called \n“decimal.” \n\nThe word “decimal” comes from the Latin word ‘Decem’, which means"

So what do we \ndo? \n\nWe reuse the available digits but by adding a new digit. \n\nSo after 9, the next number becomes: \n\n10 (which we call ‘ten’) \n\nThen the counting continues: 11, 12, 13, ..., 19, 20, 21, ... \n\n \n\fAnd this continues forward — until we reach 99. \n\nNow when we reach 99, we’ve already used all the available digits. \n\nSo to go further, we add another new digit, and the next number becomes: \n\n100 (which we call ‘hundred’) \n\nThus, in the decimal number system, we can create infinite numbers using only \n10 symbols (0 to 9) — by adding new digits and placing them at different place \nvalues. \n\n🔠 Hexadecimal Number System \nJust like the decimal number system has 10 symbols, there is another number \nsystem called the Hexadecimal Number System. \n\nThis system has 16 symbols: \n\n10 symbols from 0 to 9, and then A, B, C, D, E, F \n\n(Here, A to F represent the values from 10 to 15 respectively.) \n\nSo, the complete set is: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F \n\nThis is why it is called \"Hexa\" (meaning 6) + \"Decimal\" (meaning 10) = \nHexadecimal, a base-16"

Since no new symbol is left, what do we do? \n\nWe add a new digit, just like we did in decimal after 9. \n\nSo after F, comes: 10 (which is equal to 16 in decimal) \n\nThen the counting continues: 11, 12, 13, ..., 1F (where 1F equals 31 in decimal) \n\nThen: 20, 21, ..., 2F, and so on. \n\n⚙️ Binary Number System \nAnother number system is called the \"Binary Number System.\" \n\nIn binary, we have only two symbols: 0 and 1 \n\n\fThat’s why it’s called a base-2 number system. \n\nHow is counting done in Binary? \nCounting starts: 0, 1 \n\nNow we’ve used all the available symbols (0 and 1).

Within \nchips, all communication, signal transmission, and processing happens — all in \nthe form of binary numbers. \n\nWhy Binary? \n\n \n\fBecause in electronics, it is very easy to create and detect only two states: \n\nON (meaning current is flowing, bulb is on) \n\nOFF (meaning no current, bulb is off) \n\nWe can name them anything, like: \n\nON = High, 1, Yes, Max \n\nOFF = Low, 0, No, Min \n\nSo the binary system (Binary = 2 states) is the easiest and most suitable for \nelectronics. That’s why computers, mobiles, and chip designs use binary \nnumbers. \n\n🧮 Power and Bits in Binary \nNow an important question: \n\nIf I have n bits, how many different numbers can I make? \n\nThe formula is: Total Possibilities = 2^n \n\nExamples: \n\n1 bit → 2^1 = 2 numbers: 0, 1 \n\n \n\f2 bits → 2^2 = 4 numbers: 00, 01, 10, 11 \n\n3 bits → 2^3 = 8 numbers \n\n4 bits → 2^4 = 16 numbers \n\nSo if a number has 4 bits, we can make a total of 16 different binary numbers. \n\nIn binary, each \"digit\" is called a bit. \n\nWhen several bits combine to"

Ignore where \nit's 0. In 1001, only positions 3 and 0 have 1 → i.e., take 8 and 1. \n\nNow add these values:   \n8 + 1 = 9 \n\nSo, the decimal equivalent of binary 1001 is 9 \n\n     11001 \n\nBinary:   1   1   0   0   1   \nPowers:   4   3   2   1   0   \nValues:  16   8   4   2   1 \n\nTake only the values at positions where binary has 1 → 16, 8, and 1 \n\n \n\fAdd: 16 + 8 + 1 = 25 → Decimal equivalent of 11001 is 25 \n\n     10001 \n\nBinary:  1  0  0  0  1   \nPowers:  4  3  2  1  0   \nValues: 16  8  4  2  1 \n\nOnly 16 and 1 are taken (rest are zero) →"

To \nrepresent larger numbers, we need more bits. \n\nExamples: \n\n2 bits → 2² = 4 numbers (0 to 3)   \n3 bits → 2³ = 8 numbers (0 to 7)   \n4 bits → 2⁴ = 16 numbers (0 to 15) \n\nSo if you"

That means this \nmethod is correct and reliable. \n\nSimilarly, converting 17 gives 10001, and 11 gives 1011 \n\nSo we can write: \n\n11 = 1011 \n\nNow from just looking, one"

But in binary, \"11\" is also valid (equal to \ndecimal 3). \n\nLikewise, \"1011\" could be 1011 in decimal or 11 in binary. \n\nSo it's difficult to identify which number belongs to which number system. \n\n🔍 Solving Confusion Between Decimal and Binary \nEvery number system is clarified by writing its base: \n\nDecimal numbers are represented as base 10: (11)₁₀   \nBinary numbers are represented as base 2: (1011)₂   \nOctal numbers are represented as base 8 \n\n\fSo if we write: \n\n(11)₁₀ = (1011)₂ \n\nThen anyone can understand that 11 is decimal and its equivalent binary number \nis 1011 \n\nSo always remember, when comparing binary and decimal numbers, always \nwrite the base to avoid confusion. \n\n➕ Binary Number Addition   \n\nNow let’s understand how to add binary numbers. \n\nBinary addition is very easy because it only has two digits - 0 and 1. That means \nthere are fewer possible combinations. Binary has only four basic additions: \n\n0 + 0 = 0   \n0 + 1 = 1   \n1 + 0 = 1   \n1 + 1 = 10 (i.e., 0 with a carry of 1) \n\nUsing these four rules, we can easily add any two binary numbers. \n\nExample 1: 3 + 4 = 7 \n\nIn binary: \n\n \n\f3 = 011   \n4 = 100 \n\nAddition: \n\n011   \n+ 100"

The process is very simple — \njust like in decimal, except here we only use 0 and 1. \n\n    Remember a simple rule: \n\n0 × anything = 0   \n1 × anything = the same number \n\nExample 1: 3 × 4 = 12 \n\nIn binary: \n\n3 = 011   \n4 = 100 \n\nMultiplication: \n\n011   (3)   \n      × 100   (4)   \n   ________________ \n        000   ← multiplied by 0   \n       000X   ← again by 0   \n     011XX   ← multiplied by 1 (shifted 2 places)   \n   ________________ \n     01100  = 12 (in decimal) \n\n \n\fExample 2: 3 × 7 = 21 \n\nIn"

Each of these pins works with binary values, meaning they can only \ncarry either a 0 (representing OFF/Low) or a 1 (representing ON/High). \n\nLet’s take a simple example to understand this better. \n\nSuppose we have 3 Input pins named A, B, and C. \nSince each pin can only be 0 or 1, we can create multiple unique combinations by \nvarying these 0s and 1s across the three pins. \n\nFor 1 pin, there are 2 combinations → 0 or 1 \n\nFor 2 pins, → 2² = 4 combinations \n\nFor 3 pins, → 2³ = 8 combinations \n\nSo with 3 Input pins (A, B, C), we can create 8 unique binary input combinations. \n\nThese combinations are:  \n\n000  001  010  011  100  101  110  111   \n\n \n\fThis means the chip can receive 8 different possible input cases."

Suppose we have 4 Output pins named J, K, L, \nand M. \nFor each input combination, we can decide what values should be present on \neach Output pin. These outputs, too, will be binary — combinations of 0s and 1s. \n\nExample: \n\nIf A=0, B=0, C=0 → Output could be: J=0, K=0, L=0, M=0 → Which is 0000 \n\nIf A=0, B=0, C=1 → Output could be: J=0, K=1, L=0, M=1 → Which is 0101 \n\nThis way, for every one of the 8 possible input combinations, the output pins can \nbe set to any binary value, depending on the client’s requirement. \n\nThe number of Input and Output pins is not fixed — it completely depends on \nwhat the client or system designer wants. \n\nMore Input pins mean more possible combinations, making the system more \ncomplex. \n\nMore Output pins allow for more information or actions to be conveyed from the \nchip to the external world. \n\n \n\fEach Input combination will have an Output associated with it, and this entire \nmapping is decided by the client depending on the specific task the chip has to \nperform. \n\nThis entire Input-Output mapping is implemented as logic inside the chip.

But \nbefore we can dive deep into designing chips, circuits, and complex systems, \nthere’s something very important we must do first. \n\nBefore learning advanced concepts, we need to build a strong foundation by \nunderstanding the basic fundamentals of electronics. Without these basics, it \nwould be difficult to fully grasp the logic behind how chips work, how circuits \nbehave, or how signals flow through electronic components. \n\nThat’s exactly what we are going to focus on in this chapter. \nWe will learn the essential Basics of Electronics and Circuit Design, which are the \nbuilding blocks for everything that comes next. \n\n \n\fIn this part, we will clarify several important basic concepts of electronics, such \nas: \n\n•  What is current and voltage? \n•  How do electronic components like resistors and capacitors work? \n•  How do we create circuits using these components? \n\nThese fundamentals are very important because they will help you clearly \nunderstand how digital circuits are designed inside semiconductor chips, how \nthose circuits process binary data (0s and 1s), and how everything fits together \nto build complete electronic systems. \n\nThink of this chapter as the foundation of a building — the stronger the \nfoundation, the stronger and taller the building can be. \nWith this understanding in place, you’ll be fully prepared for the more advanced \nchip and circuit design topics that are coming up next. \n\n⚙️ Chip Design Specifications \n\nWhen we talk about designing a chip, there is always a client or customer who \ngives instructions about what kind of chip they need.

Power  \n\n•  How much electrical energy (power) the chip uses while working. \n•  Lower power consumption is better, especially for mobile devices \n\nlike smartphones, where battery life matters. \n\n2.

Physical Specifications (PPA) — \n\n•  How much power will the chip consume \n•  How quickly will it give the result \n•  How much physical space will it occupy \n\nNow the question is — how is all this possible? How can we know how much time \nit will take or how much power will be required? \n\nFor that, we need to understand the basic principles of electronics. \nWithout understanding these concepts, we can’t move forward in chip design. \n\nThat’s why, in this chapter, we will begin with one of the most fundamental \nconcepts of electronics — Electric Current, because this is what actually moves \nbinary signals (0 and 1) in inputs and outputs. \n\nLet’s now explore and understand what Electric Current is, how it flows in \ncircuits, and what role it plays in making a chip function properly. \n\n🔁 Electric Current \n\nElectric current can sometimes feel a bit tricky or confusing to understand, \nespecially for beginners.

The current is invisible, and that \nmakes it harder to imagine what’s really going on or in which direction it is \nflowing. \n\nSince we cannot directly see the current moving, understanding how it behaves \nand flows in a circuit can feel slightly tricky or abstract. This is why many \nstudents find the concept of electric current a little difficult in the beginning. \n\nBut don’t worry — in this chapter, we will break it down using very simple, real-life \ncomparisons and practical examples. Wherever possible, we’ll compare electric \ncurrent to things you already know, like water flowing through pipes to make the \nexplanation clear and relatable. \n\nThe goal here is just one — that you clearly understand what electric current \nactually is and how it works. \n\n🚰 Water Flow Analogy \n\nTo understand electric current better, let’s take a very simple and relatable \nexample — the flow of water. \n\n \n\fWe’ve all seen how water flows through a pipe. When we open a tap, water starts \nmoving in a particular direction inside the pipe. The best part is that we can \nactually see the water flowing, which makes it very easy to understand how the \nflow works and how pressure or blockage can affect it. \n\nIn the same way, electric current is also a kind of flow — but instead of water, it’s \nthe flow of tiny particles called electrons.

In this situation, we say that there’s no \nwater current at all. \n\nNow, let’s compare this to electricity. If we have an electric wire but no flow of \nelectricity through it, then we can simply say that the electric current is zero. Just \nlike a dry, empty pipe has no water flowing through it, an unused wire has no \nelectrons moving, meaning no electric current. \n\n \n \n\fNow, imagine that we start filling the pipe with water, and the water begins to \nflow in a particular direction. As soon as that happens, we can say that there is \nwater current inside the pipe. \n\nSimilarly, when electrons start moving inside a wire in one direction, we call that \nmovement electric current.

It’s quite hard to say just by looking at the image, \nbecause the flow itself is invisible. We can see the pipe, but we can’t see the \ndirection in which the water is moving. \n\nCase 1:  \n\n \n\fNow, imagine we see an image where a pipeline is connected between two \nbuckets — one bucket on the left side has more water, while the other bucket on \nthe right side is almost empty. In this situation, we can easily say that the water \nwill naturally flow from the fuller bucket (left side) to the empty bucket (right \nside). Why can we say this so confidently? Because we have all seen this happen \nin real life — whenever we connect two containers with a pipe, water always \nflows from the fuller one to the emptier one. It’s a natural behavior of fluids, \nflowing from where there’s more to where there’s less. \n\nCase 2: \n\nNow imagine a different case. If both buckets have equal amounts of water and \nare connected by a pipe, then no water will flow from one to the other. Why? \nBecause for water to flow, there must be a difference — one side must have more \nwater (higher potential), and the other must have less water (lower potential). As \nlong as the water level on both sides is exactly the same, the flow will remain \nzero. There’s simply no reason for the water to move. \n\n \n \n\fJust like water needs a higher level on one side and a lower level on the other to \nflow, electric current also needs a difference to flow.

In the case of electricity, \nthis difference is called potential difference. \n\nNow, what creates this potential difference? A battery acts as a power source \nthat pushes electrons through a circuit. \n\nIf one end of the battery has higher potential (more electrical push) and the other \nend has lower potential, and we connect these two ends using a wire — only then \nwill the electrons start flowing, which we call electric current. \n\nIf there is no potential difference between the two sides of the battery, the \nelectrons have no reason to move — and the current will be zero. It’s exactly like \nthe case of two buckets filled equally with water — nothing moves if there’s no \ndifference. \n\nWe measure this potential difference using a unit called volts. The greater the \nvoltage of the battery, the stronger the push on the electrons, meaning more \ncurrent can flow through the circuit. A higher voltage is like having a bigger \nheight difference in a waterfall — the water falls more forcefully. \n\n \n\fTo summarize, there are two important conditions to help us clearly understand \nwhen water or electric current will flow: \n\n1.  Different volumes of water at both ends of the pipe: One end has high \n\nvolume (high potential), and the other end has low volume (low potential). \nThis difference creates water flow. \nSimilarly, electric current will flow only when there is a potential difference \n(voltage difference) between the two terminals of a battery.

Likewise, if there is no wire to \nconnect the two terminals of the battery, the electrons won’t have any path to \ntravel, and no current will flow. \n\nThat’s why it’s very important to understand not only the potential difference but \nalso the role of the wire in completing the circuit. Without a proper wire (or \nconducting path), electric current simply cannot flow at all. \n\n🧱 Electric Resistance \n\nImagine that we have three different types of pipes in front of us, each with a \ndifferent thickness: \n\n \n\f1.  P1 — A very thin pipe \n2.  P2 — A medium-sized pipe \n3.  P3 — A very thick pipe \n\nNow, let’s perform a small experiment in our imagination.

The bucket will fill at a \nmoderate speed, meaning this pipe has medium resistance. \n\n•  Finally, when we use P3 (the very thick pipe), the water will flow very easily \nand quickly, and the bucket will be filled in no time. Here, we can say that \nthe pipe is offering very little resistance to the water flow. \n\n \n\fNow, let’s connect this idea to electricity. \n\nJust like water flows through pipes, electric current flows through wires. And just \nlike the size of the pipe affects how fast water can flow, the thickness of the wire \naffects how easily electrons (which make up electric current) can flow through it. \n\nHere’s the comparison: \n\n•  Thin wire → High resistance → Slower electric current flow \n•  Medium wire → Medium resistance → Moderate current flow \n•  Thick wire → Low resistance → Faster electric current flow \n\nWhy does this happen? Because the thinner the wire, the less space there is for \nelectrons to move through. As electrons try to pass, they collide with particles \ninside the wire, creating obstruction or resistance. The more collisions, the \nharder it is for current to pass through. \n\nSo we can say: \n\n   Thin wire = More obstruction to electron flow = High resistance \n   Thick wire = Less obstruction to electron flow = Low resistance \n\nIn simple words, resistance is like a traffic jam for electrons."

Why does it take some time for the input signal to \nconvert into output? \n\nThe answer lies in two fundamental electronic components: Resistance (R) and \nCapacitance (C). Every electronic circuit, especially inside a chip, contains these \ntwo elements. Together, they form what is called an RC Network. \n\nAs soon as you provide an input to a circuit, this RC Network causes a small \ndelay before the output is generated. This is why there’s always a slight gap \nbetween giving an input and receiving an output. \n\n \n\fLet’s take an easy-to-understand example — the water supply system of a large \ncity: \n\nImagine a big water tank (like a battery) that supplies water to different homes. \nThe water travels through pipes (similar to wires in a circuit) to reach smaller \noverhead tanks in individual homes (which work like capacitors). \n\nWhen you open your tap to fill a glass of water, it takes a few seconds for the \nwater to flow, depending on two things: \n\n•  Pipe Thickness → Thicker pipes = faster water → This is like Resistance \n\n(R) in a circuit. \n\n•  Tank Size → Smaller tanks fill faster → This is like Capacitance (C) in a \n\ncircuit. \n\nIf the pipes are very narrow or the tanks are large, water takes more time to reach"

Similarly, in a circuit, higher resistance and higher capacitance lead to \ngreater delay in producing output. \n\nThe exact same principle applies inside electronic chips. Whenever a signal \ntravels inside a chip, it has to pass through this RC Network, causing a time \ndelay. \n\nLess delay = faster chip = better performance \n\nThat’s why chip designers always work to reduce these delays for better speed. \n\n \n\fFunctionality of Logic Gate \n\nusing CMOS \n\nOverview & Purpose \n\nIn this chapter, we will learn how to design Standard Logic Gates at the \ncomponent level.

The circuit is typically represented using schematic symbols \nfor NMOS and PMOS transistors or complete logic gates. This forms the \nfoundation for all subsequent steps. \n\n2.  Layout Design: \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\fOnce the logical circuit is finalized, the next critical step is the layout design. \nHere, the circuit is translated into a physical representation that specifies how \neach component will be fabricated on the silicon wafer. \n\nIn layout design, each layer of the chip — such as metal layers (used for \ninterconnections), polysilicon, and diffusion regions (used to create \ntransistors) — is drawn with precision using specialized design software. This \nlayered drawing is highly detailed and adheres to specific design rules. The \nlayout serves as the blueprint or mask that guides the physical \nimplementation of the circuit on silicon. It essentially defines the 2D geometry \nthat, once fabricated, results in the 3D structures of the actual chip \ncomponents. \n\n3.

Verification \n\nAfter the layout has been completed, it must be thoroughly verified to ensure \naccuracy and correctness. This step is known as Verification, and it ensures \nthat the physical layout truly represents the intended circuit design and \ncomplies with all manufacturing rules. \nTwo of the most important verification checks are: DRC and LVS. These \nchecks are essential to prevent costly errors during fabrication and to \nguarantee that the chip will function as intended. \n\n4.  Fabrication \n\nOnce the layout passes all verification checks, the design is considered ready \nfor fabrication. In this final step, the verified layout is transferred onto a silicon \nwafer using a series of advanced photolithography and etching processes. \n\nThe result is a physical chip where each component — from transistors to \ninterconnects — is formed with nanoscale precision. This phase transforms \nthe abstract, logic-based design into a real, working integrated circuit (IC). \n\nThis entire process — from circuit design to layout, verification, and fabrication — is \nwhat brings a conceptual design into physical reality, enabling the production of \nchips used in countless electronic devices around the world. \n\n  A Simple Example \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fTo gain a clearer understanding of the entire process, let us examine a simple, \nillustrative example.

However, \nwhen the same NMOS transistor is fabricated onto silicon, its physical appearance \nchanges entirely — as illustrated on the right.

Near both the source and drain \nregions, you’ll observe N+ doped areas. These N+ regions are heavily doped to \nenhance conductivity — a topic we’ll delve into shortly.  \n\nSo the symbol that we draw on paper or on a computer is actually a very tiny 3D \nstructure on the chip, whose dimensions are at the micrometer level. This is the \nfoundation of chip fabrication. \n\nBefore this 3D structure is built on silicon, it first exists in the form of a 2D layout — a \ncrucial step in circuit design. \n\nThis layout is created on a computer using tools such as the Icurate Tool, available \nwithin our Learning Management System (LMS). The Icurate Tool allows you to \ndesign the transistor’s physical structure with precise control over dimensions and \nlayer definitions. \n\nOnce your design is complete, the layout is saved in a specialized format called GDS \n(Graphic Data System). The GDS file is an industry-standard format used for chip \nfabrication, and it contains all the necessary geometric and layer data required to \nmanufacture the chip.  \n\nThe image shown below is a front view of the layout. \n\n \n\fIn this view, you'll observe three different colored rectangles — one green, one \norange, and one red. These represent three different layers. Each layer has a name, a \nlayer number, and a unique data type number. \n\nDuring fabrication, individual masks (or dies) are created for each of these layers. \nThese masks are used in the photolithography process to etch or deposit materials \non the silicon wafer. \n\nFor example: \n\n•  The green mask defines the substrate a \n•  The orange mask creates the N+ d"

If you're given a task like, \"Create a transistor with 2 micrometer width,\" then \nin the Icurate tool, you can set the width of that rectangle to 2 micrometers — and its \nlength will be whatever you draw vertically. That becomes the transistor's length. \n\n \n \n\fFunctionality \n\nLet us now discuss the core functionality of NMOS and PMOS transistors — why they \nare designed in this particular way, and how they actually work within a circuit. As \nintroduced in the previous chapter, NMOS and PMOS transistors function like \nswitches. When a specific logic signal (such as logic 0 or logic 1) is applied to the \ngate terminal, the transistor either turns ON or OFF. \n\nThe gate is the control terminal that determines whether or not current will flow. For \nexample, when a logic 1 (i.e., high voltage) is applied to the gate of an NMOS \ntransistor, it turns ON — allowing current to pass through. Conversely, when logic 0 is \napplied, the NMOS remains OFF, and no current flows. \n\nThis leads us to an important question — from where to where does the current flow \nin an NMOS transistor? \n\nThe answer: Current flows from the Source to the Drain.

However, this flow can only \noccur if there is a potential difference (i.e., voltage difference) between the Source \nand Drain terminals. To establish this potential difference, a voltage source (such as \na battery) is connected across these terminals. \n\n \n \n\fBut simply applying voltage across Source and Drain is not enough. If there is no \nsignal at the gate, the transistor remains OFF. This is because no conductive path (or \nchannel) is formed between the Source and Drain. \n\nHowever, when a positive voltage (logic 1) is applied to the gate, it induces the \nformation of a channel underneath the gate. This channel acts like a bridge, allowing \nelectrons to flow from Source to Drain — thereby enabling current conduction. \n\nThis process involves complex physics, which we explore in depth in our next-level \ncourse on Semiconductor Physics. For now, understand this foundational concept: \n\nApplying logic 1 to the gate of an NMOS creates a channel rich in electrons, forming \na conductive path for current to flow from Source to Drain. \n\nNow, pay close attention: A conductive channel — and thus current flow — will only \noccur when two specific conditions are met: \n\n•  There is a voltage difference between Source and Drain. \n•  There is a voltage difference between Gate and Source. \n\nThese two voltages are defined as: \n\n•  VDS – Voltage from Drain to Source \n•  VGS – Voltage from Gate to Source \n\nBoth VDS and VGS must be present for the NMOS to conduct.

To turn ON a PMOS, you must apply logic 0 (i.e., low voltage) at the gate. \n\n \n\fWhen logic 0 is applied and a potential difference exists between the Source and \nDrain, a channel is formed, enabling current to flow from Source to Drain. \n\nAs discussed earlier through analogies, think of it like a water pipeline: Applying the \nright logic signal allows the water (or current) to flow by forming a passage — in this \ncase, the channel. \n\nTo summarize: \n\n•  When you apply logic 0 or logic 1 to the gate, depending on whether it’s a \n\nPMOS or NMOS, a channel either forms or doesn’t. \n\n•  This channel formation is what determines whether or not current flows \n\nbetween the Source and Drain terminals \n\nThis is why we say that NMOS and PMOS transistors behave like switches, and their \ngate terminal acts as the control for turning the switch ON or OFF. \n\nEffect of width and length variation  \n\nLet’s now focus on a critical aspect of transistor design — how the Width and Length \nof a transistor influence its performance. \n\nSo far, we’ve viewed the transistor channel in a front-facing cross-sectional diagram \n— essentially as if sliced vertically from the front.

A wider channel offers more room for electrons to move through, \nresulting in lower electrical resistance and higher current flow. Therefore, when a \ncircuit requires higher current capacity, designers use transistors with wider gates. \n\nNow let’s examine the effect of Length. The Length of the gate defines how long the \nchannel is — essentially, the distance electrons must travel from Source to Drain. \n\n \n\fWhen this length increases, electrons encounter greater resistance, which results in \nslower performance. On the other hand, shorter gate lengths reduce resistance, \nenabling electrons to travel faster and thereby making the transistor operate more \nquickly. \n\nThis leads us to a logical question — if we want a very fast transistor, why not simply \nreduce the gate length as much as possible? \n\nAt first glance, this seems like a good idea. But the answer is: No, we cannot shorten \nthe gate length indefinitely. There are physical and technological limitations that \nprevent this. \n\nLet’s explore why. A transistor consists of Source and Drain terminals, which are \nboth N+ doped regions. These regions slightly extend under the gate area to ensure \nproper channel formation. But if the gate length becomes too short, there is a risk \nthat the Source and Drain regions might touch. If this happens, current will flow \ndirectly from Source to Drain without any control from the gate. \n\nThis condition leads to a catastrophic failure — the transistor loses its ability to act \nas a switch, which is its fundamental purpose. \n\nTo avoid such scenarios, fixed design constraints are imposed on gate dimensions. \nThese limitations are documented in a formal set of design specifications called the \nDesign Rule Deck (DRC) or the Physical Design Kit (PDK).

These rules define \nminimum allowable dimensions, spacing, overlaps, and other physical parameters \nfor transistors and other layout elements. \n\nTherefore, whenever a Layout Design is created, it must strictly adhere to the \nguidelines provided in the DRC or PDK. This ensures that the transistor can be \nfabricated successfully and will operate reliably. \n\nThis brings us to the next important question — how can we verify that our layout \ncomplies with these design rules? \n\nThe answer lies in a process known as Verification. During verification, the layout is \nchecked against all defined design rules to ensure there are no violations or errors. \nThis step is critical to ensuring that the final chip will function as intended. The \ndetails of the Verification process will be discussed in upcoming sections. \n\n\fTo deepen our understanding, let’s explore a few practical examples that illustrate \nhow transistor dimensions — specifically Width and Length — impact performance. \n\nIn the first example, we consider a transistor with a width of 1 micrometer and a \nlength of 0.18 micrometer.

As a \nresult, resistance decreases significantly, allowing more current to flow in less time. \nThis translates to a faster-operating transistor. \n\nThese three cases clearly demonstrate a fundamental principle: \n\n• \n• \n\nIncreasing Length → Increases Resistance → Slower Transistor \nIncreasing Width → Decreases Resistance → Faster Transistor \n\nNow, a natural question follows — why do we vary transistor width at all? \n\nThe answer lies in the requirements of the circuit being designed. \n\n \n\fYou do not use a single, uniform type of transistor throughout a chip. Depending on \nwhere a transistor is placed and what role it plays, its performance characteristics \nmay need to be adjusted. Sometimes, fast switching is necessary — such as in \ncritical timing paths — where the transistor must quickly respond to changes in \ninput. In such cases, the transistor is made wider to increase current flow and reduce \nswitching delay. \n\nIn other parts of the circuit, however, slower switching is desirable — to prevent \nnoise, avoid abrupt transitions, or ensure signal integrity. In those cases, the \ntransistor is designed narrower, which introduces controlled resistance and \nsmoothens the signal transition. \n\nThis design flexibility plays a vital role in managing timing delays and signal \ntransitions, as discussed in earlier chapters.

An ingot is \nessentially a large, solid cylindrical block of pure silicon. It resembles a long wooden \nlog or metallic pipe, but instead of wood or metal, it is composed of crystalline \nsilicon. This purity is of paramount importance because even the slightest impurity \nat the atomic level can affect the electrical behavior of the final chip. \n\nTo achieve the required purity, a sophisticated process called the Czochralski \nprocess is often used.

These systems form the backbone \nof today’s electronics — found in everything from laptops and smartphones to \nsatellites, aircraft, and industrial machines around the world. \n\nFabrication Process \n\nSilicon substrate \n\n \n \n\fLet us now closely examine how the fabrication process is carried out on a silicon \nwafer. \n\nTo begin any integrated circuit design, a silicon wafer is essential. This wafer is a \nthin, precisely cut circular disc, sliced from a highly pure silicon ingot — a large \ncylindrical block of monocrystalline silicon. \n\nThe dimensions of the wafer can vary based on the manufacturing scale and design \nrequirements. To simplify our understanding, we’ll use a T-shaped layout in our \nexplanation. It is important to note that this T-shape is purely illustrative — real \ncircuit layouts are often far more intricate, with patterns that can be rectangular, \nplus-shaped (+), or highly complex geometries, depending on the circuit’s \nfunctionality. \n\nOxidation \n\nWe begin the fabrication process with a silicon wafer, which serves as the \nfoundational substrate for building integrated circuits. \n\nThe first step in this process is known as Oxidation. \n\nDuring oxidation, a thin layer of silicon dioxide (SiO₂) is thermally grown on the \nsurface of the wafer. This oxide layer is essential, as it acts as a base for defining \nand isolating various regions during subsequent steps in transistor fabrication. \n\nThe silicon dioxide layer is later patterned, etched, or modified to create precise \nge"

Its behavior is straightforward: \n\n•  Regions exposed to light become soluble and can be removed during the \n\ndevelopment process. \n\n•  Regions not exposed to light remain intact, acting as a protective mask for the \n\nunderlying layers. \n\nAt this point, a natural question arises: How are such incredibly small and intricate \npatterns created? \n\nThe answer lies in a process called Photolithography — a core technology in \nsemiconductor manufacturing that enables the creation of millions to billions of \ntransistors within an extremely small area. \n\nAs previously discussed, even a 1GB memory chip can contain approximately 1.08 \nbillion transistors.

Once the layout is finalized, a photomask—commonly referred to as a \nmask—is fabricated based on the design. \n\nYou can think of a mask as a high-precision stencil. Similar to cutting a T-shape into \na sheet of paper, the mask contains transparent sections where light is allowed to \npass through, and opaque sections where light is blocked. These transparent areas \ncorrespond exactly to the intended layout pattern.  \n\n \n\fWith the mask prepared, the next step is known as the Exposure Process. During this \nstep, intense ultraviolet (UV) light is projected onto the wafer through the mask. \n\nBecause the mask blocks light in all areas except the defined T-shape, only the T-\nshaped region of the photoresist layer on the wafer gets exposed to UV light. The \nremaining regions are protected from exposure. \n\nIt’s important to understand a key nuance here: light, when passing through corners \nor fine edges of the mask, does not create perfectly sharp boundaries. This is due to \ndiffraction effects — a phenomenon where light bends slightly around the edges. As \na result, even a geometrically sharp T-shape may appear with slightly rounded \ncorners on the wafer. \n\nThis limitation is well known in semiconductor manufacturing and is managed \nthrough advanced techniques in more advanced fabrication processes. \n\n \n\fFollowing exposure, the wafer undergoes a development process: \n\n•  Exposed areas of the photoresist"

The condenser’s role is to collimate, align, and \nfocus the incoming light rays, ensuring that the illumination is both uniform and \ncontrolled. \n\nAfter passing through the condenser, the light is directed into a high-precision lens \nsystem.

Let’s understand this in a structured and professional manner. \n\nWhen we design a chip, the first step is to prepare the Layout Design. This layout \ntypically consists of 2D rectangles, lines, and various shapes — as shown on the left \nside of the diagram. You can see rectangles in different colors, such as red and blue. \nOn the computer, this layout appears perfectly clean and sharp, and we expect it will \nbe replicated exactly the same way on the silicon wafer. \n\nBut in reality, this is not what happens. \n\nAs soon as the layout passes through the Photolithography Process, it gets distorted \nat several points due to the effects of the mask, light, lens, and chemical reactions. \n\n \n\fYou can observe this on the right side of the diagram, where the Design Variation by \nLithography is illustrated. \n\nCorner Rounding Effect \n\nWhen light falls on the wafer through the mask, the rectangles that appear sharp and \nclean in the layout design do not come out the same after fabrication. \n\nThis is due to the wave nature of light. As light passes through the cut-out regions of \nthe mask, slight diffraction occurs at the edges. \n\nAs a result, the sharp 90° corners designed in the layout become rounded corners in \nthe final fabricated structure. \n\n     In the diagram: \n\nNotice the two long rectangles on the left — they are designed with straight, sharp \nedges.

However, during photolithography, due to light diffraction and \nphotoresist sensitivity, these shapes may unintentionally merge. \n\n     In the diagram: \n\nOn the left, there is a visible gap between the two rectangles. But on the right, the \nsame shapes appear connected. \n\nThis can result in a short circuit, potentially making the circuit non-functional. \n\nWidth variations – opens and shorts \n\nDuring photolithography, the light exposure effect varies between horizontal and \nvertical shapes, because light intensity and focus are not uniform in all directions. \n\n•  Horizontal shapes may become slightly wider, due to greater light spread. \n•  Vertical shapes may become narrower, due to less light at the edges or \n\nuneven removal of photoresist. \n\n     In the diagram: \n\nOn the left is a line with uniform thickness. \n\nOn the right, the horizontal line is thicker, and the vertical line is thinner. \n\n \n \n\fThese width variations directly affect the resistance and capacitance of the circuit, \nimpacting overall performance. \n\nDesign overlaps \n\nWhen shapes are placed edge-to-edge in the layout (i.e., one touches another exactly \nat its boundary), the photolithography process may cause the shapes to overlap or \nmisalign. \n\n     In the diagram: \n\nLook at the red and blue rectangles at the top. \n\nIn the layout, they are clearly separated. \n\nBut in the fabricated version, the edges do not remain distinct and appear \nmisaligned. \n\nThese overlaps can result in functional errors, causing logic gates or memory cells to \nbehave incorrectly. \n\nIt is impossible to manually verify all such conditions, because a single technology \nnode can involve thousands of DRC rules.

Hence, specialized software tools, known \nas DRC Tools (Design Rule Check Tools), are used. These tools analyze the layout on \na computer and automatically highlight rule violations. \n\nBy using tools like the Icurate Tool, you can learn these rules practically and gain \nhands-on experience in correcting Design Rule Violations. Dedicated chapters are \navailable to guide you through this process, enabling you to perform it on your own. \n\n \n \n\fImportance of Gate cap \n\nLet us now explore another important example related to transistor fabrication. \n\nA typical transistor consists of three fundamental components — the Gate, Source, \nand Drain. It is essential to maintain precise spacing and structure among these \nelements to ensure correct transistor operation. \n\nYou may have observed that in many designs, the Gate is intentionally extended \nslightly forward. But why is this done? \n\nThe reason ties back to the principles discussed earlier — during photolithography, \nas light passes through the mask, it undergoes diffraction, causing the corners of \nshapes to become rounded. \n\nIf the Gate is designed exactly edge-to-edge between the Source and Drain, then due \nto light spreading and rounding effects, its printed shape may become distorted. \nThis distortion can lead to the Source and Drain unintentionally connecting, resulting \nin a short circuit. \n\nThis poses a critical issue, because the Gate plays the key role in switching the \ntransistor ON and OFF. If the Source and Drain are already connected due to \nfabrication distortion, the transistor will never fully turn OFF, even when the Gate is \ninactive.

This leads to constant and unintended current flow, which can severely \nimpact the performance of the chip, and in many cases, cause permanent damage to \nthe circuit. \n\nTo prevent such failures, the Gate is designed to extend slightly forward. With this \nextension, the shape that is ultimately formed on the silicon after photolithography \nensures proper separation between the Source and Drain. This design adjustment \nensures that the transistor functions correctly and reliably. \n\n \n\f     This concept is illustrated clearly in the diagram: \n\nOn the side where the Gate is extended, there is a visible and accurate separation \nbetween the Source and Drain, preventing any short circuit. \n\nOn the other side, where the Gate was aligned edge-to-edge, the Source and Drain \nbecome connected, rendering the transistor non-functional. \n\nDesign Verification \n\nLet us now consolidate everything we've learned to clearly understand the complete \nprocess of chip design and fabrication. The development of any chip primarily \ninvolves two key stages: Circuit Design and Layout Design. \n\nCircuit Design refers to the symbolic or schematic representation of the circuit. In \nthis phase, we use standard symbols to depict components such as NMOS and \nPMOS transistors, resistors, and capacitors. However, simply drawing these symbols \nis not sufficient. Each component must also have its properties and parameters \ndefined—for instance, specifying the width and length of a transistor to ensure it \nperforms correctly during simulation and in real-world implementation. \n\nMoving to the Layout Design stage, we transition from symbolic representation to a \nphysical one. While the schematic shows how components are connected logically, \nlayout design defines where and how each component will be constructed on the \nsilicon wafer.

This layout becomes the blueprint for \nfabrication, as it is transferred directly onto the silicon wafer during the \nmanufacturing process. \n\n \n\fLayout Versus Schematic (LVS) \n\nAn important question arises at this stage: Is the layout I have created an exact \nmatch to the original circuit I designed? Or have errors been introduced in the \nprocess? \n\nSuch discrepancies are indeed possible. For instance, while the schematic might \ncontain 1,000 transistors, it is entirely feasible that only 998 were implemented \nduring layout, or that 1,200 were unintentionally included. If a layout with such \ninconsistencies is sent directly for fabrication without validation, it can lead to \nsignificant functional failures and wasted resources. \n\nTo identify and prevent these types of errors, the industry relies on a verification \nprocess known as Layout Versus Schematic (LVS). The purpose of LVS is to ensure \nthat the layout precisely matches the original schematic design. Any mismatches—\nwhether in connectivity, component count, or structure—are flagged by the LVS tool. \n\nA successful LVS check confirms that the layout implementation is consistent with \nthe intended circuit design, providing confidence that the chip will function as \nexpected once fabricated. \n\nDesign Rule Check (DRC) \n\nThe second and more critical verification step in chip design is known as the Design \nRule Check (DRC). The primary objective of DRC is to ensure that the physical layout \nof the chip adheres strictly to the manufacturing constraints defined by the target \nsemiconductor technology. \n\nThese design rules are essential because they guarantee that the chip can be reliably \nfabricated without functional defects."

A failure to meet even a single rule can render \nthe design non-manufacturable, which is why passing the DRC is an absolute \nprerequisite before proceeding to fabrication. \n\nThis raises an important question: Where do these rules originate? The answer lies in \nthe specific semiconductor technology being used. Each technology node—such as \n180 nanometers or 90 nanometers—comes with its own comprehensive set of \ndesign rules. For example, in 180 nm technology, the minimum allowable transistor \ngate length is 180 nm. In contrast, for 90 nm technology, this minimum reduces to \n90 nm. \n\nAs process nodes continue to shrink and technology evolves, these design rules \nbecome increasingly precise and restrictive. This progression enables the creation of \nsmaller, faster, and more power-efficient chips, driving innovation across the \nsemiconductor industry. \n\n\fIn Design Rule Check (DRC), there are many different types of rules that must be \ncarefully followed during the design process. \n\nTogether, these rules ensure that the layout we are creating is suitable for fabrication \nand free from any technical errors. \n\nSome basic types of DRC rules can be practiced using the Icurate Tool: \n\n•  Spacing Rule: \n\nWhen we place two different layers in a design, there must be a minimum \ndistance between them. \nIf they are placed too close to each other, they might merge during fabrication, \nwhich can lead to circuit errors. \nTherefore, a minimum spacing is defined that must be maintained between \nany two layers. \n\n•  Minimum Area Rule: \n\nIf a shape is made too small, it might disappear during fabrication or may not \nform properly. \nHence, each"

These include rules for Latch-Up, Antenna effects, Density, and \nmany more, which are covered in advanced training. \n\n \n \n \n\fIt is not practical to check all these rules manually, which is why DRC Verification \nTools are used.
